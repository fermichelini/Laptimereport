# 🏁 Lap Time Analysis Report – Super2 Townsville Round

This project is part of my personal journey to develop practical and efficient data tools for motorsport using Python. In racing, decisions must be made within minutes – and the value of data lies in how fast and clearly it can guide those decisions.

## 🔍 What It Does

Using lap time data from the Super2 Series (Townsville 2025), this tool generates a complete HTML report in under **3 seconds**, providing actionable insights such as:

- 📈 **Lap Improvement Analysis**: Track how much each driver improved throughout the race, considering their average pace and best laps.
- 📊 **Boxplots**: Visualize lap time consistency and variation per driver and team.
- 📐 **Timing Heatmaps**: Compare sector performance across all drivers in a clear and color-coded layout.
- 📍 **Radar Charts**: Highlight sector strengths and weaknesses for each **car**, not just the driver.
- 🧠 **Team Insights**: Group laps by stint (or simulated stint for sprint races) to understand trends and performance across the race duration.

## ⚙️ Tools Used

- **Python** (pandas, NumPy)
- **Plotly** for interactive visualizations
- **HTML export** for easy sharing
- **Jupyter Notebook** for development

## 🧪 Output Example

The report is delivered as a standalone interactive HTML file, ready to share or embed in presentations, LinkedIn posts, or internal debriefs.

## 💡 Motivation

The goal wasn’t to build a complex system, but rather something useful. Motorsport data is often limited to lap times – but with the right analysis, even that can tell powerful stories. This tool was created to extract meaning quickly and visually, helping engineers and teams make better decisions in less time.
